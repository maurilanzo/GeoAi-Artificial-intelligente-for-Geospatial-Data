GeoAI — Semantic Segmentation on Geospatial Data (2D & 3D)

This repository contains the work developed for the GeoAI course project and final exam.
It focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence techniques — in particular, semantic segmentation — to geospatial data such as satellite imagery (2D) and 3D point clouds.

Repository Contents:

 Semantic_Segmentation_2D.ipynb
Notebook demonstrating semantic segmentation on 2D geospatial data, such as satellite or aerial imagery.
It explores model architectures, preprocessing steps, and performance evaluation on real geospatial datasets.

 Semantic_Segmentation_3D.ipynb
Notebook dedicated to 3D semantic segmentation, focusing on point cloud data.
It investigates how neural networks can identify and classify spatial structures in 3D environments.
